Development
-----------

If starting with a clean repo, install virtualenv and dev requirements::

    make deps

Virtual environment is created in `build/` folder.::

    . build/bin/activate

Run tests::
    make test
    or
    nosetests


Manual testing Leaderboard
--------------------------

Check the server launch, but you can not do to many things as it needs to be
fed with GitHub hooks and to connect to a Trac instance

For highscores, you will need to place a trac.db file in build/ so that it
will some something to work on.

To launch the Leaderboard server use:

    make leaderboard

To see the report for this month:

    make report TIME=YYYY-MM-DD


Manual testing IRC plugins
--------------------------

Do all the tests in #chevah-test to not add noise to the main channel.

First you need to get the credentials, by placing the `client_id.json` in repo
root and then run.

    make irc-bot-oauth

You only need to get the credentials once.
After that you can launch the IRC bot::

    make irc-bot
